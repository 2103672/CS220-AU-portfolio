## Work Experience
### Warehouse Operative

07/2021 - 08/2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; 

As a summer job before I went to University, I worked 12 hours each day Monday â€“ Thursday as a warehouse operative in Clipper 535 and Daventry 2, in which I assisted in the picking, packing, and tipping of both NHS stock at clipper 535 and mountain warehouse stock at Daventry 2. The work ethic allowed me to exceptionally improve my teamwork skills and confidence within a group of people working towards the same goal. The physical labour of collecting and preparing the stock allowed for an improvement of my logic and problem-solving skills, by learning to work with both time and energy efficiency. 

#### Waiter
 
07/2017 - 08/2017 

Whilst holidaying with my family in turkey, I worked as a waiter for 3 days a week. I would welcome guests, take their food and drink orders and serve them in the restaurant or on the beach. I would take their orders in either English or Turkish. This allowed me to improve my foreign language and communication skills as I spoke to Turkish locals using my Turkish speaking skills.

## Projects
### Extended Project Qualification
During my A levels, I completed an extended project qualification, in which I tackled the question "what is the difference between scary and creepy?". The project looked at both phenomenons biologically backed with studies and evolutionary theory to consider the differences in function and purpose of feeling scared and creeped out. The project consisted of a 4000 word essay, presentation of my project and the progression of creating it, and a log of my experience whilst doing the extended project. I used images and tables throughout my essay and referenced studies accordingly. 

### Novel
I am in the process of writing a horror novel called "The Lure". It is about a young girl named Angelica who lives in a big wooden estate, surrounded by a deep forest, in which her perception of reality get progressively more distorted as the story goes on. I have been inspired by many authors and horror writers to have a go at writing my own, such as Neil Gaiman and his book "Coraline", The playstation game "Little nightmares", and the Graphic novel "The Enigma of Amigara Fault" by Junji Ito. The themes of ambiguity, isolation and distortion of realities in these stories heavily inspired my story and will present these themes within the upcoming chapters. I have written chapter one and have a story board for the next chapters.
